Slicelang(working, not final, name) is platform independeble general purpose programming language is designing for subject areas which requires extreme hight safe and robust such as military, banking and space (satellite, space station etc) soft. Its cover following aspects of code protection:
<ul>  
  <li>modern type system with abstract types and without type/immutable waterfall
  <li>force use only abstractions
  <li>data centric object system
  <li>force immutable data
  <li>force copy data rather then use ref
  <li>per data guards, input/output guards
  <li><a href=https://github.com/bga/slicelang/blob/master/docs/axioms.md>type axioms
  <li>functional way working with collections rather then plain loops
  <li>per function unit test as part of function's spec directly in code
  <li>code prove system
  <li>various code analysers
</ul>
Slicelang has also other modern features:
<ul>
  <li>automatic code paralellisation
  <li>easy concurent system w/o deadlocks and race conditions
  <li>full type algebra
  <li>extreme DRY standard library
  <li>simple but powerfull versioning system
</ul>
